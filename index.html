			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<image src="./Assets/images/me.jpg" id=me-pic>
				<p> Hello! I am a young professional, new to the coding world.  After living in New York City for 4 years, I decided to move to a new city in the fall of 2017 and explore a new field. I am currently a special project manager at a language services company, where I work a lot with our tech team, which got me interested in coding.  Learning a new skill is scary, but exciting! </p>
	<br>
				<p>When I'm not working or coding, I enjoy music, movies, and anything to do with pop culture. I also been known to love a good internet meme, especially if it invovles my girl Oprah.  I am also a dog mom to a 3-year old Sato mix named Rico, who was rescued the Vieques Puerto Rico when he was just 6 weeks old.</p>
